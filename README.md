 Puzzle Bobble Project


 2016 v0.3

EGYPCIANS:
We are a group formed by 4 UPC students 

- Eric Abad 
- Guillem Arman
- Pau Bordes
- Guillem Dom√≠nguez

that are recreating the game called Puzzle Bobble 2 (Bust-a-Move 2) from Taito.
The objective of the game is to pop all the bubbles making groups of 3 or more bubbles of the same color.

There is a link to a video of a full gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MMq7yrV6fI

The game has (for now) 4 stages that have each of them special controls: 


WELCOME SCREEN:

* C - Put coin/credit
* Space bar - next screen

MODE MENU:

* S - select game mode
* Space bar - next screen


LEVEL 1:

* Left/Right - Aim the arrow
* S - Shoot bubbles
* Q - go to the WELCOME SCREEN
* Space bar - next screen

GAME OVER:

* Space bar - go to the WELCOME SCREEN


In each of the stages, we have implemented the music and fx sound.
In this version there is still no win/lose condition as we weren't able to make the bubbles pop.
There is a grid of bubbles of different colors.
