 Puzzle Bobble Project


 2016 v0.5

EGYPCIANS:
We are a group formed by 4 UPC students 

- Eric Abad 
- Guillem Arman
- Pau Bordes
- Guillem Domínguez

that are recreating the game called Puzzle Bobble 2 (Bust-a-Move 2) from Taito.

The game has (for now) 4 stages that have each of them special controls: 


WELCOME SCREEN:

C - Put coin/credit
Space bar - next screen

MODE MENU:

S - select game mode
Space bar - next screen


LEVEL 1:

Left/Right - Aim the arrow
S - Shoot bubbles
Q - go to the WELCOME SCREEN
Space bar - next screen

GAME OVER:

Space bar - go to the WELCOME SCREEN


In each of the stages, we have implemented the music and fx sound.
To win the first level, the player needs to pop all the bubbles before the time is over (the bubbles still don't go down over time).
