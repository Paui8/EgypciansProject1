EGYPCIANS:
We are a group formed by 4 UPC students 

- Eric Abad 
- Guillem Arman
- Pau Bordes
- Guillem Domínguez

that are recreating the game called Puzzle Bobble 2 (Bust-a-Move Again) from Taito.

Here you can see a longplay of the game --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MMq7yrV6fI

The objective of this arcade game is to clear every bubble of each level, to finish all the rounds.
In order to pop bubbles the player needs to connect 3 or more bubbles of each color.
If the player isn't able to clear the level before a bubble reaches the lower line the game is over.
The player also loses if he cannot do it in time (60 seconds).

Our game has a WELCOME SCREEN, a MODE SELECTION MENU, LEVELS 1-2-3, a CONGRATULATIONS SCREEN and a GAME OVER SCREEN. 
Each of the screens have controls:
