  "body": "# Puzzle Bobble 2\r\n\r\nPuzzle Bobble 2 , also known as Bust-a-Move Again, is a 1995 arcade puzzle game (for 1 or 2 players) created by Taito Corporation.\r\nIt is a simple game based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, featuring characters and themes from the original.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this arcade game is to clear every bubble of each level, to finish all the rounds.\r\nIn order to pop bubbles the player needs to connect 3 or more bubbles of each color.\r\nIf the player isn't able to clear the level before a bubble reaches the lower line the game is over.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MMq7yrV6fI\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Team Members \r\n\r\nWe are a group of four students from the CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimèdia) that is part of the UPC, who are studying Video Games Design and Development. And for our Project 1 subject we are trying to recreate an arcade game called Puzzle Bobble 2. Everyone is the responsible for one of the parts of the project, even though we all contributed to make the whole.\r\n\r\n*  **Eric Abad**: QA\r\n*  **Guillem Arman**: Audio & Art\r\n*  **Pau Bordes**: Management\r\n*  **Guillem Domínguez**: Code\r\n\r\n![Egypcians Team](http://i.imgur.com/W3kFKdJ.jpg)\r\n",
